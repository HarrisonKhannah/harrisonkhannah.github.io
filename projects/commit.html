                <p>The primary use case for the Comm-It is for problematic individuals who want assistance regulating

                    world.” (Sebag-Montefiore, 2017) Research has shown gamblers “continue to persist, even after
                    suffering extreme financial loss” (Jazaeri, 2012). By incorporating barriers that the gamblers set
                    themselves, it encourages them to deter themselves from the activity </p>

                <div>
                    <p>To understand this problem space we had to understand what was the issue at hand, who we should
                        engage with to delve deeper into this issue, and how?
                        From this, we designed our research to uncover all the current issues at hand in this sector. We
                        did this through delving into:
                    </p>

                        <div>
                            <h3>Structural</h3>
                            <p>In terms of structural characteristics, we found that the two most important factors for
                                problem gamblers are
                                'fast reel spins' and bright flashing lights and sounds as rewarding for any amount of
                                money 'won' as the
                                machine's own form of positive reinforcement</p>
                        </div>

                        <div>
                            <h3>Venue</h3>
                            <p>Following an extensive legal and policy review, we found that there was very little which
                                could actually be
                                altered in the physical problem location. The findings demonstrated a need for
                                self-regulation.
                                Self-regulation would be the basis for many of our concepts, as there are ‘negotiable
                                areas’ within what a
                                gambler can utilise to assist themselves with self-regulation.</p>
                        </div>


                        <div>
                            <h3>Psychological</h3>
                            <p>From interviewing several psychologists and councillors, we found that problem gambling
                                can be mapped on a spectrum as there are 3
                                factors which characterise
                                an individual’s own experience with pathological gambling. These are: their experiences,
                                addictions and
                                treatment. Other than this, there is no uniform definition for what ‘problem gambling’
                                entails, and
                                currently only describes that an individual spends excess time and finance doing this
                                activity.</p>

                <h3>Ideation</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>With the criteria in mind we used forced association to diverge our ideation. We gathered the
                        themes explored
                        within our criteria and began rapidly ideating. We began finding correlations between different
                        elements within our ideation, specifically in regard to commitment and spending, the involvement
                        of families,
                        and trying to get the user physically away from the environment itself. We used crazy eights to
                        collaboratively build
                        upon these areas to iterate and benefit future solutions.

                <h3>The chosen concept</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>The chosen concept that came out of the iteration stages was the Comm-it. It was a simple
                        phone/watch application that encouragess someone who is wanting to stop gambling to set their
                        own barriers and limitaitons on the money they spend. Moreover, most gamblers achieve the best
                        results when their family is encouraging them through the process. This thereby lends itself to
                        the installation of the "family mode", in which a the gambler can opt in for a family member to
                        help and track their progress, if they so wish. </p>

                        <div>
                            <h3> It's inherit problem and how we went about solving it</h3>
                            <p>A precondition is that: users have to want help - or they will manipulate others to
                                achieve their
                                goals. Multiple use cases were explored, determining multiple alternative flows
                                where manipulation
                                could be invoked from the problematic individual. From the use case exploration it
                                was clear the
                                manipulation of the system was going to be a great concern for the outcome of the
                                ‘Comm-it’.
                                Likewise, uptake of the Comm-it, is likely to be relatively low due to the lack of
                                user control and
                                freedom.

                <h3>Our Iteration Strategy</h3>
                <div>
                    <p><strong>Usability mix test: Think aloud/roleplay </strong>
                        The aim of mixed usability testing was to test our conceptual model against our user’s
                        mental model, to understand if our design principle implementation was successful and where the
                        core errors were. We implemented role-play to understand the usability in conjunction with
                        conceptual application and think aloud to find out why the users are having issues.
                    </p> <br><br>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Think-aloud: </strong>The method allowed us to not only figure out where the errors
                        were, by
                        why.
                        Throughout the iterations, think aloud’s provided key data in our problem of ‘clarity’, and
                        allowed us to determine whether or not it was navigation clarity or the lack of conceptual
                        information.
                    </p><br><br>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Roleplaying </strong>was a method used to test the concept. As only the gambler could
                        use the
                        wearable,
                        we couldn’t have one user test both devices. Therefore, one facilitator acted out what the
                        corresponding persona would be doing.

                    <h2>Outcomes of User Research and its implementation into iteration one</h2>
                    <p>
                        From the presentation of our solution’s future directions of the original concept were
                        discussed:
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>How can we reduce alcohol related violence?</strong>
                        The Comm-it was further developed to implement Alt-funs concept of relaxation – breaking the
                        negative
                        feedback loop through relaxation techniques of mindfulness. This was updated through a new
                        breathing
                        feature. It uses vibration to assist with breathing techniques. The function ‘pops-up’ if the
                        wearable determines heart rate is too high (built in Apple Watch function), and the vibration
                        increases suggesting breathing in, decreasing to suggest breathing out.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>How can we make it more accessible for individuals who have been drinking?</strong>
                        The Comm-it removed many of the wearable functions, reducing it to bare minimum so users can use
                        it
                        while under the influence of alcohol. This applies the, 80/20 rule and flexibility usability
                        trade
                        off.
                        <br><br>



                        <strong>How can you reduce the commitment level over time?</strong>
                        There is a new overall limit, where users can reduce cash out limit and payment limit over time.
                        This was an implementation suggested by our tutor.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>How can you ensure users won’t break?</strong>
                        Through providing external regulation. The Comm-it implemented multiple factors of the involve
                        system, including increased communication with the loved one through a new messaging function,
                        the
                        viewing of past activity, time and date of gambling. All of which allow the family to be more
                        involved, and provide them with more monitoring abilities that will assist the users to “not
                        break”.

                    <h2>Outcomes of User Research and its implementation into iteration two</h2>
                   <p> From the first test, explorations of the problems allowed for direct areas of the product to
                    implement solutions. A newset of objectives were needed to be met:</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p><strong>How can we decrease the anger, numbness and sadness while using this application?</strong><br>
                    Goals were implemented, allowing the application to target the ‘anger’ through providing the users
                    with ‘new strengths”
                    (Bethel Funerals, 2019) Goals allow the user to retrain their learnt behaviour. Streaks will be
                    implemented, as they
                    provide a form of “gamification” ("What Are Streaks and Why do They Work?", 2019), allowing us to
                    implement user
                    feedback from round one as stated “there needs to be more fun” Streaks are “habit
                    forming”, they provide a
                    sense of “motivation” ("Benefits of Goal Setting", n.d.)

                    If the user completes a goal, they get congratulatory messages, allowing us to counteract the
                    “numbness” and “Sadness”
                    with “affirmation” and “positive reinforcement” (Bethel Funerals, 2019). It provides a “pat on the
                    back” for the users
                    (Morin, 2019). Messages have pre suggested options, as it was a core suggestion from user feedback as, it likewise reduces
                    the risk of users sending shocking messages to get the gambler home “I’d use it to shock the user
                    e.g. I’m leaving you”
                   
                    All of which works on operant conditioning. If we apply positive reinforcement to users completing
                    goals “it makes it
                    more likely that the behaviour will occur again in the future” (Cherry, 2019). We provide the users
                    with “social
                    reinforcers” through the use of congratulatory pop up notifications (Cherry, 2019).

                        <br><br>
                    <strong>How can we assist regulation, while providing increased control?</strong><br>

                    Implementing user feedback feedback and added a self regulation function. As discussed
                    previously to supplement
                    the lack of control, goals will be introduced to apply personal motivation. Through research we
                    found a correlation
                    between control and trust, “Control is good, but trust is better” (Jensen, 2014), due to the users
                    having no control
                    there was no trust with the families “Total control means zero trust” (Jensen, 2014). Limiting was
                    removed, as users
                    didn’t like how only families could do it.
                        <br><br>
                   <strong>How can we gain more ‘trust’ with the user?</strong><br>

                    <strong>How can we implement more educational components into the product?</strong><br>
                    Added fun fact at the beginning of the application, as “education helps to bring
                    productive results” (Reddy,
                    n.d.)
                        <br><br>
                    
                   <strong> How can the product provide more of a personalised experience?</strong><br>
                    Implemented names, and personalised goals. This was important as “74% of customers feel
                    frustrated when
                    content isn’t personalised” (Burgess, n.d.)

                    <h2>From the presentation of our solution’s future directions of the original concept were
                        discussed: </h2>

                      <ol>  <li>How can the criteria of stress be positively affected without removing the source of stress
                        (goals)?</li>
                        <li>How can education and control change?</li>
                        <li>How can mindfulness be implemented while also minimising the ‘annoyance’ for some?</li>
                      </ol>

                    <br><br>
                    <p><strong>The design freeze of mindfulness</strong><br>
                        Mindfulness was a concept implemented at the start of the iteration process, but properly tested
                        in iteration two. The usability testing users stated that in theory it would decrease anger, but
                        the execution might increase it. Specifically, the use of vibration. Due to our mock-ups unable
                        to implement the element of vibration, the problem cannot be reliability tested. However, other
                        sensory mechanisms were discussed. The use of visual flashy and sound would be unviable, and the
                        context of the gambling room would distract. Therefore, only touch and smell are left. Smell
                        isn’t technologically feasible yet, and touch is already implemented with the vibration.
                        Therefore, the team decided to implement a ‘design freeze’ into the mindfulness problem.


                        <br><br>
                    <strong>How can education and control change?</strong><br>

After previous development on education and control, based on prior feedback, the criteria did not improve, and in the
case of education; got worse. The concept of “notifying the users on their lack of control” became unnecessary, as users
have increased control in ‘self-regulation’, therefore the criteria is subjective to the mode they pick. It is also
important to discuss, we are testing with gamblers, individuals who state they as ‘casual’, they don’t believe they have
a problem. This may affect their perception on the concept of control, as they don’t want to stop gambling, thus don’t
want reduced control. In relation to education, users stated they needed more “personalised education” which was the
concept behind the previous implementations. After discussion into the criteria of education, the team decided that
‘identification of problematic behaviour’ was very similar to education. Therefore, the criteria of education were also
removed.

                        <br><br>
                   <strong>How can the criteria of stress be positively affected without removing the source of stress (goals)?</strong><br>
A large conceptual change occurred in iteration 2 after high amounts of negative reactions to the product. The
implementation of goals, self-regulation, and positive conditioning reduced the anger and sadness. However, all of which
has increased stress. Goals and streaks made the user stressed due to the added pressure of not wanting to ‘break them’.
Previously the pressure came from the product, now the pressures are coming from within the user. This is both negative
and positive. Negative as users stress will decrease desirability, but positive as users are able to more effectively
self-regulate without the need for external control. Therefore, as a team we collective decided that a trade-off must
occur. Which is worse domestic violence or a user feeling pressured to stick to a limit they set themselves? While we
are still investing in the problem area of ‘emotion’, the criteria of ‘reducing stress’ has become obsolete.

        <h2>Final Solution</h2>
        <div>
            <p>The original com-it was a wearable pre-commitment card, that told the users to stop, when they used all
                their money. Following weeks of iteration, numerous development sprints, user testing and exploration.
                the commit has evolved. Once a product that put up barriers on excessive spending. Now: a device that
                encourages the user to set their own barriers and deter themselves.
                <br><br>
                The com-its aim was never to solve the gambling problem in Australia, but to help the users problem with
                gambling. As a team, we believe we have succeeded in our aim. The com-it encourages family
                communication, and provides self help methods, for gamblers who want help. It gives a physical visual on
                income lost, rather than income gained. It gives the user goals and aspirations, to assist their change
                management process. The com-it continuously encourages the user through their time of loss.
<br><br>
                The development of this product has not only has ensured improved usability and user satisfaction, but
                has made us continuously more aware of our users’ internal conflict. Allowing the com-it to develop
                alongside the user.
<br><br>
                Therefore, the com-it was once just to commit to reduced spending, now it's committing to your limit,
                your family, but more importantly – yourself.
