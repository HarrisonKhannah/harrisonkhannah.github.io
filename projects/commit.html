                <p>The primary use case for the Comm-It is for problematic individuals who want assistance regulating
                    excessive spending. “Australian lose more money from gambling than any developed nation in the
                    world.” (Sebag-Montefiore, 2017) Research has shown gamblers “continue to persist, even after
                    suffering extreme financial loss” (Jazaeri, 2012). </p>

<h3>Research</h3>
<div>
   <p>To understand this problem space we had to understand what was the issue at hand, who we should engage with to delve deeper into this issue, and how?
       From this, we designed our research to uncover all the current issues at hand in this sector. We did this through delving into:
 </p>
 <section class = "hidden-stage--breakdown">
 <div>
     <h3>Structural</h3>
     <p>In terms of structural characteristics, we found that the two most important factors for problem gamblers are
         'fast reel spins' and bright flashing lights and sounds as rewarding for any amount of money 'won' as the
         machine's own form of positive reinforcement</p>
 </div>

  <div>
      <h3>Venue</h3>
      <p>Following an extensive legal and policy review, we found that there was very little which could actually be
          altered in the physical problem location. The findings demonstrated a need for self-regulation.
          Self-regulation would be the basis for many of our concepts, as there are ‘negotiable areas’ within what a
          gambler can utilise to assist themselves with self-regulation.</p>
  </div>


    <div>
        <h3>Psychological</h3>
        <p>From interviewing several psychologists and councillors, we found that problem gambling can be mapped on a spectrum as there are 3
            factors which characterise
            an individual’s own experience with pathological gambling. These are: their experiences, addictions and
            treatment. Other than this, there is no uniform definition for what ‘problem gambling’ entails, and
            currently only describes that an individual spends excess time and finance doing this activity.</p>

<h3>Ideation</h3>
<div>
    <p>With the criteria in mind we used forced association to diverge our ideation. We gathered the themes explored
        within our criteria and began rapidly ideating. We began finding correlations between different
        elements within our ideation, specifically in regard to commitment and spending, the involvement of families,
        and trying to get the user physically away from the environment itself. We used crazy eights to collaboratively build
        upon these areas to iterate and benefit future solutions.
