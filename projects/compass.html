                    <p>Through my work on the developing the website and other front-end visuals, alongside working with a team of enginners and marketers - Compass IoT has
                        become a
                        leading industry tool in transport/traffic management projects for councils, governments,

                <p class = "lead">The website for Compass IoT can be seen below. Through the use of HTML and CSS, alongside Javascript and libraries, the website utilities a minimal and sleek UI. Moreover, the website has been attached to an inhouse CRM built by myself. Through all the forms running through "EmailJS" -  a clientside JS library that allows forms submissions to be fed directly into the inhouse CRM. </p>

                            <p class="lead">Alongside the website was the creation of the FAQ system. This was created
                                through Gatsby.js and utilises Node.js and GraphQL. This is done so the marketing team
                                can curate a FAQ article in Google Sheets and have it instantaneously built on the site
                                through the power of GraphQL. The UI takes a similar approach to the main site and
                                follows the brandings clean, minimal aesthetic </p>
